# UCP-3D-Simulation-using-Unity
 UCP 3D Simulation is an immersive and interactive Unity project that replicates the University of Central Punjab campus. It offers a realistic virtual environment with accurate buildings, interactive navigation, dynamic elements, and an intuitive user interface.


The folder with the name UCP Simulator has the source files and the other folder has the source code and project that you can open in Unity.

Spent a lot of time on this project as I did it all alone
